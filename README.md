# Emotion-Detection-Through-Facial-Guestures
 
# Training Phase  
The proposed network has been trained with about 7800 training images (70% of the
images after pre-processing) taken from FER-2013  database. This database contains
seven standard categories of emotions for every subject. During training process deep
convolutional neural network has been applied for feature extraction and training clas‐
sification. It uses supervised learning approach over huge number of images. 

# Testing Phase
The proposed network has been tested with about 3400 test images (30% of the images
after pre-processing) taken from FER-2013 database. Like training phase, in the testing
phase, feature extraction is completed using proposed convolutional neural network.
But classification of emotion is decided after matching of extracted features with trained
features.

Classes for Output are -->
  (i)   Anger
  (ii)  Sad
  (iii) Disgust
  (iv)  Fear
  (v)  Happy
  (vi) Surprise
  (vii) Neutral
